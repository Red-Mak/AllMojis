# AllMojis
An iOS keyboard to see how emojis will look like in others platforms/apps.
This Application was rejected by Apple twice, so i open source it :)

You will find some unused code; it was used for other purpose like alphabetic keyboard, Gifs .. but as i decided to have a simple app in v1 then add other features in next verions.

Plateforms/Applications supported are:
 * apple
 * emoji-one
 * facebook
 * google
 * lg
 * htc
 * messenger
 * microsoft
 * samsung
 * twitter
